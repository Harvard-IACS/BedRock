**Instructor:**  Pavlos Protopapas, Scientific Program Director at Harvard's [IACS](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/) 

# Course Introduction

Welcome! The objective of this course is to serve as a 'refresher' for fundamental concepts in math, statistics, & programming required to undertake a course in machine learning, data science, or A.I. similar to IACS's own [CS109a](TODO) or an equivalent.

The course consists primarily of pre-recorded lecture and tutorial videos with accompanying coding exercises taken from a similar course offered by IACS in January of 2022.

Participation is entirely optional and you can progress through the material at your own pace. Don't worry if you are unable to participate or if you're unable to complete all parts of the course. This course will have no direct effect on any grades nor on your standing within your program. 

As you progress in your learning journey, our friendly teaching staff will be here to support you through the course **[discussion forum](TODO)** as well as **online office hours** (schedule TBD).

## Course Overview 

- Basic Python: Data types, data structures, functions
- Advanced Python: Python Classes
- Probability & Statistics
- Linear Algebra & Calculus
- Linear Regression

**Detailed Topics:**

**Python:**

- Python operators, loops & iterators 
- Python data structures such as sets, lists, dictionaries 
- Python functions & classes
- Code debugging, third party modules 
- NumPy - Numerical Python
- Pandas - tabular data in Python

**Stats & Probability**

- Random Variable
- Probability Density Function
- Some ‚Äòstandard‚Äô distributions and their mean/stdev (Normal, Binomial)
- Properties of mean and variance

**Calculus:**

- Derivatives (including partial)
- What does ‚Äòlinear‚Äô mean?
- Properties of linear models

**Linear Algebra:**

- Matrix Operations
  - Matrix Multiplication
  - Matrix Inverse
  - Transpose
  - Dot Product
- Linear Combinations

**Linear Regression:**

- Loss Function
- Optimization
- Design Matrix
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Train/Test Split

# Prerequisites

Some prior programming experience in any language and previous exposure to calculus is assumed. Again, the goal is to refresh those topics that you feel have become a bit 'rusty' and/or to fill in any gaps in your understanding. Those starting from scratch with no previous experience will likely find things move too fast for them.

## Course Components

## Lessons

The learning materials for each topic are bundled into Ed [lessons](TODO). Lessons will help students develop the intuition for core concepts, providing the necessary mathematical background, guidance on technical details, and relevant examples. You can start right now with [Lesson 1](TODO)!

## Reading Assignments and Video Assignments 

Lessons include readings, lecture slides, and lecture videos. The goal of the reading is to prepare you for the lesson content, familiarize you with new terminology and definitions, and to help you determine which part of the subject may need more attention. 

Each session may have a short 'reading check' at the beginning which covers the assigned reading for that week. This will help assess your understanding of the material.

## Quizzes & Exercises

- Most lessons also include exercises and quizzes. Quizzes are for self assessment. The exercises can be attempted as many times as you wish.

# Course Policies

## Getting Help

For questions about homework, course content, package installation, after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:

- Post the question on the [course discussion forum](TODO). Note that forum posts are visible to everyone. The teaching staff monitors the posts. You are encouraged to answer your peers' questions! üòÅ 
- Attend an online office hour (schedule TBD).

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

We actively seek and welcome people of diverse identities, from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods since Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates our social, cultural, economic, and political interactions [1]. 

We believe in creating and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where all members feel safe, respected, and capable of producing their best work. 

We commit to an experience for all participants that is free from -- Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.
- Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks during any of the learning activities.
