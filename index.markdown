The objective of the BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE course is to provide you with the fundamental skills in math, statistics, and programming that you will need in order to undertake a course in machine learning, data science, or AI.


You will begin with the basics of Python, statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus, and then apply those basics to topics like Numpy, Pandas, derivatives, and optimization.  **TODO: consult new structure of content**

At the end of the course, you will have the tools to tackle a rigorous course in machine learning, data science, or AI, along with the confidence and hands-on training youâ€™ll need to take your learning to the next level.

BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE takes place asynchronously in approximately two-hour sessions. Led by IACS Scientific Program Director Pavlos Protopapas, the program will give you access to a team of teaching fellows, live Q\&A, personalized break-out sessions, and a library of resources. 

To make the most of this workshop, you'll want to be familiar with mathematical notation for multidimensional objects like vectors, matrices, and tensors. A deep knowledge of Linear Algebra is not required, but understanding how vectors represent a direction and magnitude, and how basic operations using vectors and matrices are performed, will be helpful.



##### Part of knowing where you are going is knowing where to begin and we are here to help you plan those first steps and get the most out of your BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE experience. 

**While BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE assumes little to no previous programming experience and will cover the basics of variables, operators, and functions,** **you can make the most of this series with a brief review of major math topics listed below.** 

**Don't know where to begin? We have a provided a list of resources to help you develop the confidence and skills** **to set you up for success!**
