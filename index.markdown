#### Old Intro
  
The objective of the BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE course is to provide you with the fundamental skills in math, statistics, and programming that you will need in order to undertake a course in machine learning, data science, or AI.


You will begin with the basics of Python, statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus, and then apply those basics to topics like Numpy, Pandas, derivatives, and optimization.  **TODO: consult new structure of content**

At the end of the course, you will have the tools to tackle a rigorous course in machine learning, data science, or AI, along with the confidence and hands-on training youâ€™ll need to take your learning to the next level.

BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE takes place asynchronously in approximately two-hour sessions. Led by IACS Scientific Program Director Pavlos Protopapas, the program will give you access to a team of teaching fellows, live Q\&A, personalized break-out sessions, and a library of resources.
