To make the most of this workshop, you'll want to be familiar with mathematical notation for multidimensional objects like vectors, matrices, and tensors. A deep knowledge of Linear Algebra is not required, but understanding how vectors represent a direction and magnitude, and how basic operations using vectors and matrices are performed, will be helpful.

**Part of knowing where you are going is knowing where to begin and we are here to help you plan those first steps and get the most out of your BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE experience.**

**While BEDROCK DATA SCIENCE assumes little to no previous programming experience and will cover the basics of variables, operators, and functions,** **you can make the most of this series with a brief review of major math topics listed below.** 

**Don't know where to begin? We have a provided a list of resources to help you develop the confidence and skills** **to set you up for success!**

### Vectors, Matrics, and Tensors

To make the most of this workshop, you'll want to be familiar with mathematical notation for multidimensional objects like vectors, matrices, and tensors. A deep knowledge of Linear Algebra is not required, but understanding how vectors represent a direction and magnitude, and how basic operations using vectors and matrices are performed, will be helpful.

### Mathematical Notation

Appreciating many of the examples presented in this series will require familiarity with sigma notation and subscripting of variables. You can brush up on the basics and then use the practice examples from MIT OpenCourseWare to test your skills.

- "Summation Notation Practice" by MIT OpenCourseWare ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHErQuZ8M-I))

### Calculus

On the final day of the series weâ€™ll be using some calculus. The concept of a derivative will be reintroduced and briefly defined, and you'll then be using a few basic calculus rules (and vector/matrix operations described earlier) to optimize your machine learning model. Reviewing the idea of a derivative and some basic derivative rules might help reduce math anxiety (and give you a leg up on working on your models).
